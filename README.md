# Real Time Rainfall Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

ðŸš€ Project Overview: This project is a Rainfall Prediction System using a Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained on weather data and deployed as a Flask Web App. Users can input a city to predict whether it will rain.

ðŸŒŸ Tech Stack:

Machine Learning: Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning)

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, SMOTE (for handling imbalance)

Model Evaluation: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix

Web Framework: Flask (Backend)

Frontend: HTML, CSS
